/*

1) a) This solution would have a Big O notation of O(1).
    You only need to ask the question once (operation)
    in order to receive the wanted output (person with
    a retriever).

   b) This solution would hav a Big O notation of O(n).
    You would use a for loop to iterate through the length
    of the 'arr' of dog owners until you found the dog you
    are looking for or ran out of dog owners.

2) This solution would have a Big O notation of O(1) because
 there will only ever be one operation running each time
 you call the function.

3) This solution would have a Big O notation of O(n^2) because
 there is a set (2) nested loops. The outer loop will run with the 
 inner loop (n) times. Each time, the inner loop will run (n) times.
 (If there was ANOTHER nested loop the complexity would then be
 o(n^3))

4) The Big O notation for this algorithm would be O(n).
 There is only one for loop meaning the number of
 operations is directly linked to how many pieces of data
 are in the input.
 
5) The Big O notation for this algorithm would be O(n). Only ONE item 
is being seached for but we do not know the length of the array.  This 
would mean it would continue to iterate through the loop until 
the correct item is located then return the index number.

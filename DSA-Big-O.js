/*

1) a)This solution would have a Big O notation of O(1).
    You only need to ask the question once (operation)
    in order to receive the wanted output (person with
    a retriever).

   b)This solution would hav a Big O notation of O(n).
    You would use a for loop to iterate through the length
    of the 'arr' of dog owners until you found the dog you
    are looking for or ran out of dog owners.

2)This solution wuold have a Big O notation of O(1) because
 there will only ever be one operation running each time
 you call the function.
